 Book Scraper Project
This project scrapes book information (title, price, rating) from Books to Scrape using Python and BeautifulSoup. It also stores the data in a CSV file and creates a bar chart visualization of book ratings.

🔍 Project Overview
This web scraping project demonstrates the use of Python for data extraction and visualization. The data includes book titles, prices, and ratings collected across 50 pages of the website. The dataset is then saved to CSV and visualized using a bar chart to show rating distributions.

📁 Files Included
books_data.csv – Scraped book data (title, price, rating)
books_bar_chart.png – Bar chart showing the number of books by rating
book_scraper.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with scraping and visualization code
README.md – Project documentation and author information
